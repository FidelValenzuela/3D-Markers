## Project Structure

This project is a basic HTML/CSS application with a single HTML file for structure and a CSS file for styling. Here’s a breakdown of each file and its purpose:

- **`index.html`**: Defines the layout and structure of the markers. It includes the container and marker elements, with each marker having a `cap` and `sleeve` section.
- **`styles.css`**: Adds the styling for each marker color (red, green, blue) using CSS gradients and shadows. The CSS also defines the layout properties, allowing for a centered display and flexible styling adjustments.

## Installation

To view and use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. (Optional) Edit the `styles.css` file to experiment with different colors, shadows, or layout options.

## Usage

The project is intended for learning and visual demonstration purposes. Opening `index.html` in a browser will display three color markers in red, green, and blue, centered on the page. Each marker has a `cap` and `sleeve` section, allowing for a stylized marker representation.

You can use this project as:

- A foundation to practice and understand CSS gradients, shadows, and layout techniques.
- A starting point to build similar, color-coded UI elements or as a component in larger projects.
